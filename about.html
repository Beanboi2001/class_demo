            <p>
                As a young boy, Damian Hatfield was always interested in games. As he grew, he got his hands on a wide variety of games. 
                He spent much of his youth playing games, so much so that he would go on to consider himself a gamer. 
                In his senior year of high school, he decided to give back to the community he spent most of his life in.

            <h2>About the studio</h2>
            <p>
                During college, he worked on a passion project of his, which was an early version of What Remains. 
                He had some of his friends help him make the game, which spurred them into make a game development studio of their own.
